I certify that I have listed all the sources that I used to develop the solutions and code to the submitted work.

On my honor as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized help
on this academic work.

I did not utilize any help from any external sources to complete this assignment. This assignment required us to implement a Doubly Linked List data structure utilizing a struct for each node and a DLL class for the functions implementation. This assignment tested our abilities to understand the concepts presented in class regarding doubly linked lists and challenged us to implement them. I did not run into any trouble completing this assignment. The assignment works as it should, without any compilation errors. I tested this program for correctness by calling different functions on different Doubly Linked List class to verify if they are working correctly for different linked lists.
