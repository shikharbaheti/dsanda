I certify that I have listed all the sources that I used to develop the solutions and code to the submitted work.

On my honor as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized help
on this academic work.

I did not utilize any help from any external sources to complete this assignment. This assignment required us to implement a Doubly Linked List data structure by templating it. Templating allows a programmer to write genetic algorithms that can be utilized later to be made specific. The assignment works as it should, without any compilation errors. I tested this program for correctness by calling different functions on templated (string, in this case) Doubly Linked List class to verify if they are working correctly for different linked lists and their operations.
