I certify that I have listed all the sources that I used to develop the solutions and code to the submitted work.

On my honor as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized help
on this academic work.

I did not utilize any help from any external sources to complete this assignment. This assignment required us to create a templated version of the Collection class along with using templated functions (including other enum classes). Furthermore, we created a new class, Jeans, utilizing the same functionality as the Stress Balls class and tested it by using our templated Collection class. I did not run into any trouble completing this assignment. I tested this program for correctness by calling different functions on different Collections to verify if they are working correctly. 

3) Write about the generic programming using templates based on this assignment Part 3.
Generic programming is a style of computer programming that enables developers to write algorithms/classes in terms of abstraction and in terms of 'to be made specific later' than hard-coding types/instantiation upon coding style. This makes programs and algorithms generic to be used later for other data types. It increases code flexibility and reusability in a bigger code base. An example of this can be seen in the STL library provided by C++ with sort(). Sort() works on any data type because it a generic algorithm made with templates. In this assignment, we made our Collection class a templated class so that we can use its functions in different types of other classes (like Stress Balls and Jeans).
