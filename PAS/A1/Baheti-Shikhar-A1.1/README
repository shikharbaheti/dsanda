On my honor as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized help
on this academic work.

I utilized some of my previous assignments in CSCE 121 to complete this assignment such as how to declare classes, etc. I recieved no external help from the Internet but I did ask my TAs on assistance on the ENUM classes. This assignment was a warm up of our knowledge of C++ and required us to create a Class Stress Balls that contains a stress ball with varying sizes and colors based upon an enum class. This assignment required us to declare private and public functions in our class in order to randomly assign colors and sizes to the Stress Ball. We also created default constructors for the classes. 

I certify that I have listed all the sources that I used to develop the solutions and code to the
submitted work.
