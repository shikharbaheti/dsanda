I certify that I have listed all the sources that I used to develop the solutions and code to the
submitted work.

On my honor as an Aggie, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized help
on this academic work.

I did not utilize any help from any external sources to complete this assignment. This assignment required us to create Collection classes which held different tyes of stress balls and enabled us to do different functions on it such as inserting stress balls from a datafile, making unions of different stress ball collections, etc. I did not run into any trouble completing this assignment. I tested this program for correctness by calling different functions on different Collections to verify if they are working correctly.
